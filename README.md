Blasting Volume Prediction in Iron Ore Mining

This project aims to predict the volume of material blasted in an iron ore mine using a machine learning model. The model is trained on a FYâ€™23 dataset and utilizes various supervised learning techniques to provide accurate predictions. This project is valuable for decision-making in the Steel Manufacturing sector.

Key Features

Data Analysis: Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify key patterns.

Data Preparation: Performed data cleaning and transformation for better model performance.

Predictive Modeling: Applied machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model for blasting volume.

Visualization: Visualized blasting parameters to provide actionable insights.


Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook

About the dataset: THIS DATASET IS TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM BLASTING REPORT OF AN IRON ORE MINE OF FY23 AND ITS A REAL WORLD DATASET WHICH I GOT FROM MY SENIOR.
